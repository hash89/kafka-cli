# kafka-client
Command line tool for managing kafka and kafka connect.

The goal of this client, is to facilitate the use of kafka scripts and REST API call.

You can find all the command here : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html

Before starting, you will need 3 (or 4) environement variables
- KAFKA_HOME : define the kafka root to execute scripts
- KAFKA_BROKERS : used for call to kafka brokers
- KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER : used (in almost every command) for call to zookeeper
- (KAFKA_CONNECT) : used if the distributed connect process is on different hosts than kafka brokers

You can use the client with this command, and see the usage
